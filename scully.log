Folder "./scully" doesn't seem to contain custom plugins Deprication Notice:
       ======================================================================
         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin in the scully.json file. For your convenience,
         we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choiche.
         for Puppteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.documentation.config.ts file.

          When you get this waring while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.
          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
       ======================================================================Using deprecated plugin type:"render"  use "postProcessByHtml" instead
